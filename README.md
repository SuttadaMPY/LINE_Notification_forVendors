# LINE_Notification_forVendors
This will retrieve data from sheet URL and notify vendors after payment transaction.

This is my project, which collaboration with my friends, in Service Learning in Mathematics course.

Verification of payment method from customers still needs to be improved.
This code can now send a notification to the vendors' LINE only after payment transaction has been manually verified.
